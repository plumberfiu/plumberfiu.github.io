<p>At Big Blue Plumbing, we are experts in high effectiveness warm water heaters. The previous decade has actually brought a host of brand-new, more different alternatives for improving your water heater's energy effectiveness and reducing your utility bills. Whereas warm water heaters used to come in either tank or tankless options, there are now even more options for improving water heating energy usage. Tankless Hot Water Heater - If you are tight on area, or if you have an interest in cutting down on energy costs when heating water for usage throughout your house, then you may want to consider the installation of a tankless water heater.

<p>During the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water created in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this brine goes through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are consequently sent out to drain. This process continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll discover percentages of salt going to drain together with the firmness ions) and the bed is considered totally regenerated.</p>

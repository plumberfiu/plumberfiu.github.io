<p>Backflow is bad news. Clamp the drain hose. The water softener requires to drain the diminished brine service after the regrowth cycle. Clamp the drain hose securely and feed it into the devoted drain, like a floor drain or utility sink. To prevent the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain hose pipes must have an air space. The end of the hose be at least two inches above the dedicated drain. An air gap may be utilized to attain this, and may be needed depending on local plumbing codes.</p>
<p>Both techniques are extremely effective and decreasing waste and clearing it. The biggest distinction remains in timing. With a batch disposal, you fill the unit, cover it, then turn it on.

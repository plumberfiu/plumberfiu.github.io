<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific brand-new sinks, however these will be labeled to that impact. If you can't use plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in location. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Ensure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>

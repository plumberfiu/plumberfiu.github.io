I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a significant clog that required excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

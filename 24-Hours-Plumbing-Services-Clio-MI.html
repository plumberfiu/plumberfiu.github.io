<p>Salt-free systems will also lower scale buildup and offer brighter clothes and softer skin using a healthier method. The main benefit with salt-free systems is the ability to soften water without needing to add salt to the water. This is a more heart ecologically friendly and healthy system. Standard salt-based systems include salt to the water which can have a negative effect on people with high-blood pressure and heart problem. Some cities are starting to ban salt-based softeners due to the high salt content in the waste water. Salt-free systems are maintenance totally free and use no waste water, no electrical energy and no salt or chemicals.

During periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

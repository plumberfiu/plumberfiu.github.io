<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- destructive.

Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is merely recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (generally salt or often potassium).</p>

CenterPoint Energy's House Service Plus offers you an optional Pipe Protection Prepare for only $3.95 a month. It covers interior, easily accessible, natural gas pipes running from the gas meter to your gas home appliances.</p>
<p>Running a gas line to a grill or fire pit costs $20 per foot, or $200 to $700 usually depending on the length from the main gas line. Setting up a natural gas line for a grill costs $99 to $600, while a fire pit that's out in the lawn costs $300 to $1,400. You might have an issue with high water pressure if your water heater stops working due to sediment construct up in the tank. The water pressure builds and may eventually trigger the tank to take off. This triggers thousands of dollars in water and residential or commercial property damage to your home.</p>

This develops a backflow condition and the capacity for contaminated water going into the safe and clean water circulation system. Copper is a biostatic material, which indicates bacteria will not grow on it. Copper has actually been used (along with PVC pipes) because the 1970s to replace galvanized iron pipes in old buildings. It is specifically useful for hot and cold faucet water and refrigerant lines in HEATING AND COOLING systems.</p>
<p>Because of the inherent design of a minimized pressure backflow assembly, varying supply pressure on an extremely low flow or static circulation condition may cause nuisance dripping and possible fouling of the assembly. While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve right away ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure consistent to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.

This has at times led to people believing that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there might never really have actually been an issue in the first location. This thinking can be both detrimental and dangerous. Backflow occurrences in water systems are a result of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a lowered pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or nothing technique to backflow security.

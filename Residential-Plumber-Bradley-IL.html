<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decline in provided pressure to the water flow, occurs. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's supply of water movement. This opposite flow is generally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to car traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from surrounding heavy devices operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The result is a total breakage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that allows water to leave.

<p>Trees and shrubs are a typical reason for sewer blockages to the home. Roots can grow into the tiniest crack or gap in your home's drain pipe, where they grow in the nutrient rich environment offered by the sewer. Flat roofs typically have drains spaced out around their border. The drains are linked to vertical pipes that are typically connected to underground horizontal pipes linked to local storm sewage systems. Roto-Rooter can mechanically clean these drains from one end to the other to restore circulation and prevent water collection on top of the structure's roofing system.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Most house centers carry only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door might not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>

<p>Lubrication may assist with the placement of some elements within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lubricant does not help the assembly work any better, it is only there to help the technician put together the components into the body without creating damage from friction. The lube must be a food grade lubricant to guarantee the water system is not contaminated. In many cases the best lube is water. The usual usage for lube in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings should be lightly lubricated to guarantee they do not present of their retainer. Using too much lubricant can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to use or fail out faster by drawing in dirt and debris or restricting the movement of the element. The correct amount of lubricant must make the surface of the 'ring appear wet. You need to never ever see portions or globs of lubricant.</p>

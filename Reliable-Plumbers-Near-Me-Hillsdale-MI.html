<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
<p>Although the professional agreed that the client did the best thing in her efforts to tighten the pipes, the specialist saw that the pipe had become incredibly worn away for many years and that a PVC pipe may be much better fit for the client's needs. He turned off the water system to the house, got rid of the corroded system and fit a PVC pipe in its place. Before leaving the home, the technician brought back water circulation and evaluated the pipe.</p>

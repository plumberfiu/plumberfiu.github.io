In a separate drain pathway, little pipes run from the tub and sink to ultimately meet up with a larger one beneath the toilet, bring waste and wastewater from the bathroom and eventually out of the house. A great method to decrease the quantity of food waste in your kitchen is to install a garbage disposal.

<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Considering that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than demand (generally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and cleanly stored for later use when need rate surpasses supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>

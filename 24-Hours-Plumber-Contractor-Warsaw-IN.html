These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Considering that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, usage never ever precisely matches supply.

Recently, however, toilets utilizing a vacuum flushing system have actually been appearing in more and more homes.

Similar to our trenchless services, we will first conduct pipe leak tests utilizing video and hydraulic pressure tests.</p>

While this may work in the short-term, keep in mind that the weakened pipe is made from the same product as other pipes in your home, meaning that difficulty could be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system. Repiping now will give you assurance and prevent larger leaks down the roadway.</p>

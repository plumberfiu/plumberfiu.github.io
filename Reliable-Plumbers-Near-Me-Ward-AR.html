<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When newly regrowed, the beads end up being full of salt ions from the water softener salt. As hard water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. When water is heated, hard water causes white or gray deposits. Water softening can be used to minimize these signs.</p>

He turned off the water supply to the home, eliminated the corroded system and fit a PVC pipe in its place. Prior to leaving the home, the technician restored water flow and checked the pipe.</p>

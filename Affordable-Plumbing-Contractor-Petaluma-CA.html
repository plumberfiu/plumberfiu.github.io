This has at times led to people believing that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there may never ever truly have actually been an issue in the first place.

If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of house centers carry only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more.

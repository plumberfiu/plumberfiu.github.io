<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>

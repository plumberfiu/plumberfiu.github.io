<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

Some kinds of pipes can rust with time. This rust will break off into your house's water supply and can turn your faucet water a reddish or brown  color. In this case, repiping your home is required due to the fact that not just are your pipes old, however your water quality is affected as well. When you buy a new disposal, the box will consist of all the parts you need to install it. Before you jump into getting rid of the old system, take a few minutes to acquaint yourself with all these parts. Put them together in the proper order and try the locking system. Understanding how everything fits together ahead of time will make the job a cinch.</p>

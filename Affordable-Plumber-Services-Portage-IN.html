<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario might happen. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high threat" facilities.</p>

<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall.

Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. The majority of house centers bring only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more.

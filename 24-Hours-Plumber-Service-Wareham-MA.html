<p>You'll need an unique garbage disposal if you home utilizes a septic tank and drain field. The unit needs to grind the waste even finer to avoid clogs and enable the tank to be able to drain correctly into the leach fields. As soon as, the gas pipe shows up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be wrapped, but must then shift to galvanized. I am not exactly sure why that must be. It is likewise enabled to use black iron if it is probably coated with a galvanized finish (which is essentially an unique paint"). When plumbing in their gas meters, PG&E often does this.</p>
<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, just link it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if required, to insert television back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop if the old discharge tube is too short. To avoid this, make certain the new garbage disposal installation set includes a tube, or buy one separately at the same time for about $3.</p>

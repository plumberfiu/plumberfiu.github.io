Quite a few hot water heater producers advise that you flush your water heater a minimum of once a year to decrease the accumulation of minerals. If the hot water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indication the tank is failing and will need to be changed. If it is in a garage and a little slow leak, schedule an estimate as quickly as possible and make sure nothing is near the heater that might be possibly harmed.

If you have a fluctuating water use schedule, such designs are practical.</p>

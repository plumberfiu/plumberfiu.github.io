<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits issued after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be tested each year. Likewise permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems require an annually test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers must be evaluated each year to guarantee the security of the safe and clean drinking water in your home.

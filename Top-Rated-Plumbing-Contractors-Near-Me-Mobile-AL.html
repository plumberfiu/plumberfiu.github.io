<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>

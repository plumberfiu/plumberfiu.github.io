<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it should put something back into the water. Many water softeners use an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the solidity ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the salt in the brine tank renewed.</p>

<h3>Find Registered Plumbers in  Flushing MI</h3>
<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. Because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however for the most part it must be much less water.</p>

Newer units use electronic sensors that keep track of bead depletion and other key metrics based on your water usage and therefore only regenerate when required. These newer systems, likewise referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect because they save energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>

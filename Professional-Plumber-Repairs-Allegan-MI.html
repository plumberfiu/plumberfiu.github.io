<h3>How to Remove a Sink Drain Pop Up in Allegan MI</h3>
<p>Winter season is nearly here which implies you're hectic insulating your home and protecting your plumbing from the freezing temperatures.

<p>Loosen the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to push the call a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from moving off the flange).

The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>

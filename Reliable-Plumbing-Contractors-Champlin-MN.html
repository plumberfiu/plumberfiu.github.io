<p>Close all exterior windows and doors and turn on your bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans. Then open a nearby hot water faucet until you hear the gas burner in the water heater spark. After a minute, move a smoking cigarettes match around the edge of the draft hood (Picture 7) on top of the heater. The smoke needs to be drawn up the vent pipe. The fumes from the burner aren't venting if the smoke doesn't draw. Shut off the gas to the hot water heater and call a licensed plumber to remedy the issue.</p>
<p>If you find a leak and opt for a patching job rather of a repiping job, just bear in mind that all the pipes in your home are most likely made from the exact same material and they may be next.

If your plumber's auger line is too short to reach to the end of the pipe, reach you can from the front of the drain, then start at the end of the drain and work backwards.</p>

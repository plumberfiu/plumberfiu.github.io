When hydraulic conditions within any water supply differ "typical," the direction of water flow can be reversed. This develops a backflow condition and the capacity for polluted water going into the drinkable water distribution system. Copper is a biostatic product, which suggests bacteria will not grow on it. Copper has actually been used (together with PVC pipes) since the 1970s to replace galvanized iron pipes in old buildings. It is particularly useful for cold and hot faucet water and refrigerant lines in HVAC systems.</p>
<p>Copper is a strong product that won't fall victim to massive corrosion and total pipe failure. That's why it's the trusted metal for pipe replacement these days. It stands the test of time, aside from the opportunity of pitted deterioration. That means that, sometimes, depending upon the soil around the pipes and the mineral content in the water, small holes can form in copper pipes, and you'll need to hire plumbers for repairs. A competent plumber can quickly and precisely assess the existing status of your house's plumbing and supply suggestions to ensure your convenience, health, and security.

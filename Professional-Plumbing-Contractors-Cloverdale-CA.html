<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Cloverdale CA</h3>
<p>Look for a jam. Something too hard to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Shut off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will stream backwards into the city water lines since pressure is lost during these events.</p>

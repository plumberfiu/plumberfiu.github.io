<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Biddeford ME</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic supply of water line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was actually touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Regrettably, any house that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. In some cases a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and whispering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
<p>The most effective way to resolve hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

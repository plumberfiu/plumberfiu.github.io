<p>Your first step is to turn off the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, switch off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a great time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A flexible supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Picture 5). Check the instructions if your valve is a various design from the one we reveal. After installing the valve (Picture 6), connect the fill tube (Image 7).</p>

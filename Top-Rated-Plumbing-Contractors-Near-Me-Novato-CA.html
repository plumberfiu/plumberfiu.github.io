<p>Garbage disposals are developed to operate in one of two ways. Either through what's known as a batch feed, where the system is filled, then covered prior to it is turned on, or through a continuous feed, where the unit can be filled while it is running. An authorized backflow prevention device, which need to be evaluated yearly, must be installed on the service connection that the department has recognized as having a potential for backflow.

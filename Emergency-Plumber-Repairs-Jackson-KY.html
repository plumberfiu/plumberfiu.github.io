<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be evaluated every year. Likewise permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems need an annually test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring before operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers should be tested every year to guarantee the security of the safe and clean drinking water in your home.

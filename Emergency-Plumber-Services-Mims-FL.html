<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Mims FL</h3>

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is small, however if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a stringent low sodium diet this boost can pose problems.</p>

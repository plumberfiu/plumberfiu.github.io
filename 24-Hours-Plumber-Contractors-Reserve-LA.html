<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a reduction in supplied pressure to the water circulation, takes place. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's water system movement. This opposite circulation is usually localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on automobile traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The outcome is a total damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that enables water to leave. Often no evident physical damage to the pipe is needed, just the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose shut down lead to a considerable pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>

If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are security preventative measures you should require to protect yourself, your household and your house. Some jurisdictions also allow alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water.

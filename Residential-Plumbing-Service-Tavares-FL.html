<p>Water softening is the elimination of calcium, magnesium, and specific other metal cations in hard water. The resulting soft water is more suitable with soap and extends the lifetime of some devices. Water softening is normally attained utilizing ion-exchange resins. The waste disposal unit is leaking from below your sink. Press the pointer of a screwdriver up versus the edge of the plug and tap up until you break loose the plug. Then eliminate this plastic disc from inside the disposal (you can probably hold the system upside down and shake it out).</p>

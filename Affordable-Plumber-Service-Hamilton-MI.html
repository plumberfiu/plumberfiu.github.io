In truth, you must seldom have a clogged toilet if you are using it properly and if it is functioning appropriately. If you are having a toilet that blocks constantly and in need of toilet repair from Vegas Valley Plumbing on a regular basis, then it's probably time for a new toilet.

If you haven't done so already, we recommend setting up carbon monoxide gas detectors beyond bedroom doors to inform you of any possible gas leaks.</p>

<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, reduced iron will be removed by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has currently been fouled, commercial cleaners are readily available. Again, it is advisable to examine the producer's directions for unique precautions.</p>
<p>So, how does a softener know when to get down to service? The timing of regrowth depends upon the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, despite whether the water really needs it. When needed, more recent systems use digital sensing units that keep an eye on bead depletion and other crucial metrics based on your water usage and for that reason only regrow. These more recent systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect because they conserve energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>

Once a person becomes a certified tester, there is a good chance the person understands how to check a backflow preventer.

The repair technician has a long list of things he need to learn to be able to repair a backflow prevention assembly and return it to its initial factory specs.</p>
<p>Finally, the most sophisticated and complex backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five separately operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves).

The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if costly) device is best utilized in vital areas where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>

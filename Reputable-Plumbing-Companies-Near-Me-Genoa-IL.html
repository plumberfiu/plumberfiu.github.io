No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola consists of a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Wipe with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, etc. If that does not work then use Naval Jelly which includes a lot more phosphoric acid (make certain to read the directions and security warnings first!). Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to get rid of rust stains and it's readily available at the majority of hardware stores.</p>

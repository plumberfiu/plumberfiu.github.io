<p>Leaking sewer lines inside your house can damage floorings, woodworking, and other valuable items such as cabinets. Left ignored, leaking sewer water can lead to mold and much more severe structural damage. Leaking sewer water from your main home drain or house sewer can likewise trigger substantial damage if ignored. With the flange in place and weighted down, it's time to move under the sink. The installing assembly parts are a bit different between the 2 installing systems, but the procedure is largely the very same.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be triggered due to buildup and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain will not fix the concern. You may have to look into using a high pressure water system to eliminate the clog. This process is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the seriousness of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the whole system.</p>

<p>To help avoid obstructions within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of use the technique set out above. Since the baffle efficiently halves the interior diameter of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is especially true when the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>

<p>This device, shortened RPZD, is also very efficient in preventing contamination of water supplies. Unlike other gadgets, it is created for high level hazards.

It might not be installed in any location where it might ever be submerged under water. Some towns do not enable the use of PVBs with drip irrigation systems. Some don't allow the usage of a PVB at all, so check with your water service provider. A PVB backflow preventer might spill or spit water out from under the cap when backflow occurs, so it should be set up in a place where water spillage would not trigger problems.</p>

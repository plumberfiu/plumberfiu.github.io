Lots of insurance provider will not cover a slow leak. Claims may be rejected because the basic HO-3 property owners' policy specifically leaves out "a loss as the result of a water leak over an extended amount of time."

This is a good time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6).

Set the height prior to you install the valve (Image 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Check the directions if your valve is a various style from the one we show. After installing the valve (Photo 6), link the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>

<p>Unless your bathroom restoration is purely cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing might effectively belong to your project requirements. Water gets in the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads.

The mineral deposits hold on to the resin and the now-softened water exits the softener tank and streams throughout your home. Tankless technology makes sense.

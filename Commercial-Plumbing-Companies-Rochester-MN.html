The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector streams in reverse relative to the instructions of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite flow is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes based on car traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from adjacent heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a total breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that permits water to escape. Sometimes no obvious physical damage to the pipe is needed, just the mechanical failure of a key pump whose shut down results in a substantial pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>

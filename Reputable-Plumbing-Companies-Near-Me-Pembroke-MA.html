<p>Salt-free systems will also minimize scale buildup and provide brighter clothes and softer skin using a much healthier method. The main advantage with salt-free systems is the ability to soften water without having to include sodium to the water. This is a more heart healthy and environmentally friendly system. Traditional salt-based systems add salt to the water which can have a negative effect on individuals with high-blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. Some cities are starting to prohibit salt-based softeners due to the high salt content in the waste water. Salt-free systems are maintenance free and utilize no waste water, no salt and no electrical energy or chemicals. In comparison to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are exceptionally low maintenance due to the fact that the media can last approximately 5 years without replacing. Salt-based systems need the salt to be renewed on a month-to-month basis.</p>

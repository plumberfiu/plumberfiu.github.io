<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually test a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario might happen. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high danger" establishments.</p>

<p>An air pressure test is required. The test pressure shall be at least 1 1/2 times the working pressure, however no less than 3 pounds per square inch (psi). The test period shall not be less than 10 minutes. The piping system will stand up to the test pressure defined without showing any proof of leakage or other defects.

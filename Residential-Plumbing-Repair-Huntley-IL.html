<p>Lastly, the most advanced and complicated backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five separately operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. Throughout basic water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if pricey) device is best used in critical areas where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>

After an initial inspection and testing of a freshly installed backflow preventer, the water consumer is needed to have the backflow preventer evaluated on an annual basis.</p>

We have actually outlined the process we suggest for discovering a good plumber. Now let's look at the services a good plumber must supply.

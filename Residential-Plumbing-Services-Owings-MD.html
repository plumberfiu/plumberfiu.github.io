<p>You could be squandering cash with every flush if your toilet was manufactured before 1994. Older toilets consume to 3.5 gallons per flush-- more than double the modern requirement. Plumbers often provide water conditioning and water softening services. These can be extremely valuable, particularly for home- and business owners in areas with iron or sulfur in the water. The immediate advantage to this is superior availability for homes and places with higher requirements. While an electric heater may serve for smaller households, the gas heater might be a much better option for matching needs.</p>

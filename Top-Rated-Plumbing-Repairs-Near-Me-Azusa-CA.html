<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to provide sodas beverages. Numerous, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a threat to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping containing copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>

Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is merely capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (usually salt or often potassium).</p>

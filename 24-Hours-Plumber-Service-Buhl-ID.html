<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>

This thinking can be both disadvantageous and unsafe. Backflow occurrences in water systems are an outcome of changes in pressure within that system.

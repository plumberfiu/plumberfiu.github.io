<h3>Tankless Water Heater Replacement in Newburyport Massachusetts</h2>
<p>Backflow prevention devices are designed to protect the general public water supply from cross-connections. A modern-day community water supply system is created to make sure that water flows to homes and structures under pressure. If there is a cross-connection between the water supply and an infected source, this neighborhood water network contains numerous users where there is a danger to public health. A cross-connection can occur where there is a pressure drop in the water main. This pressure drop causes a vacuum and siphons of entrainment water from end-users into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>A few local authorities require that the PVB be set up within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't utilize a PVB unless the water source is at the high end of the irrigated area. It may not be installed in any place where it might ever be immersed under water. Some municipalities do not allow the usage of PVBs with drip irrigation systems. Some don't allow the use of a PVB at all, so check with your water supplier. A PVB backflow preventer might spit or spill water out of under the cap when backflow occurs, so it must be set up in a place where water spillage would not trigger problems.</p>

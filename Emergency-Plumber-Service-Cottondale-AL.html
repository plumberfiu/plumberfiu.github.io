We've currently seen what these 2 terms have in common, so what's the difference between them? When it comes to the problem of difficult water, a traditional water softener in fact eliminates silica, magnesium and calcium ions, leaving it with small amounts of what is called short-lived firmness". The softener replaces these ions with salt through a procedure called ion exchange.</p>
<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which utilize a procedure called ion exchange to get rid of hard water minerals, salt-free water softeners use a physical process called Design template Assisted Condensation (TAC). This procedure transforms the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a firmness crystal that won't adhere to any surface in your home, keeping your home appliances and warm water heaters without hard water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are likewise called water conditioners due to the fact that they do not in fact soften" the water; They condition (or neutralize) it. And due to the fact that these kinds of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to get rid of caught ions.</p>

<p>What is tough water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains substantial quantities of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium.

While the minerals won't hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a problem-- for its many designated usages around your home.</p>

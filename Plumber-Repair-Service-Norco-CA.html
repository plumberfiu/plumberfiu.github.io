<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it hard to access to in-wall pipes, consider a minimum of changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a huge job, replacing exposed pipes in a utility, basement, or crawlspace  room is relatively uncomplicated, because the plumber can quickly get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets need to definitely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

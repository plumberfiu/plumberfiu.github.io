If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then unfavorable or reduced pressure in the 2-inch supply line will cause a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>

This is needed to stabilize the plumbing system and ensure the structural stability.

The unit should grind the waste even finer to avoid obstructions and permit the tank to be able to drain properly into the leach fields.

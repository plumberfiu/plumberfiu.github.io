<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Florence MS</h3>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB.

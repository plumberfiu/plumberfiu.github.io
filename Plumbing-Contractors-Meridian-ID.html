They do not have a sprinkler system, or any outdoor watering system at all, so they do not need backflow prevention. The primary difference among water softener designs remains in the way they arrange the backflush cycles. Due to the fact that recharging the beads with salt too early wastes salt and water, this is essential. Charging too late causes efficiency to fall off.</p>

<p>Reducing or getting rid of water solidity is made with a tool referred to as a water softener.  It is inside this softener where the ion exchange process happens. A softener is comprised of various components, each having their own distinct function. The heart of the softener is the mineral tank which is a pressure vessel usually built out of fiberglass.  These tanks are filled with adversely charged ion exchange resin.  The brains of the softener depend on the control valve or softener head as it is typically described. Most popular water softeners have an automatic regenerating system.  The most standard type has an electric timer that flushes and charges the system on a regular schedule.</p>

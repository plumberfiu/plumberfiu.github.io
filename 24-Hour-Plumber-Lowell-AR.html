<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was really promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Regrettably, any house that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. In some cases a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and whispering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>Changing a stopped working garbage disposer can appear challenging. There's the normal trepidation about electricity and water, the unfamiliar sink connection and adequate drain fittings to make leakages a real possibility. Then there are the troubles of comparison shopping and the suspicion that the job could face real money. And finally, stopped working disposers don't often leak, at least not in the start, so it's easy to put things off.</p>

Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a problem-- for its numerous desired usages around your home.</p>

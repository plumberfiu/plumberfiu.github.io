<p>Difficult water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it includes. When difficult water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so only softened water passes through to your home.

Salt is normally used in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>

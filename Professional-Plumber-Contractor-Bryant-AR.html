It normally symbolizes rust and mineral accumulation if you discover low water pressure or blemished water. As rust and minerals build up in time, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you might observe lower water pressure.

<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Because water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly constant, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than need (generally night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and cleanly kept for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
